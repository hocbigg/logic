# Summary

The Logic curriculum is a **complete education in Logic** using online materials.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### The Core Sequence

Study them **in this exact order**:

1. I. Orientation & Mathematical Literacy  
2. II. Informal Logic & Argumentation  
3. III. Formal Logic Core (Undergraduate Level) – complete all three subsections (A, B, and C)  
4. IV. Metatheory of Logic  
5. V. Limits and Extensions of Classical Logic  

### Specialization Tracks

Section VI contains three separate tracks. You should only begin these **after completing the entire Core sequence** (sections I–V). Each track goes deeper in one direction (*Choose according to your goals*):

- **A. Philosophical Logic**  
  Focuses on the connections between logic, philosophy, language, knowledge, and norms.

- **B. Logic for Computer Science & AI**  
  Focuses on the practical and theoretical tools used in programming, computation, verification, and artificial intelligence.

- **C. Mathematical Logic (Advanced)**  
  Focuses on the most abstract and foundational parts of modern logic as a branch of mathematics.
